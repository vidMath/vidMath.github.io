Following are some project ideas in my mind

1. AI that asks questions
 - For a given chapter from your history book and then questions based on the content
 - Eg, for a chapter on WW2, it can ask questions like, 
              Time period of the war, War was against which two countries, Leasers involved,etc
   Technologies used: NLP, Text Summarization

2. App that teaches you to sing
 - Given a song, it'll compare your singing to the original song and correct you on notes, expressions and pitch
   Technologies - Audio analysis

3. Reccomendation Engine
 - The traditional recommendation engine that we have recommends ,say videos on youtube based on the what clips you saw.
   But if something informative or educational videos come up in feed then it'll be better utilization of time on youtube
   Technolgies - no clue!
